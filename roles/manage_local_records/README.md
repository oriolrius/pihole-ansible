# manage_local_records

This role is designed to manage local DNS records (both A and CNAME) on one or more Pi-hole instances. It iterates over a list of Pi-hole hosts and applies record changes as defined by the user.

## Overview

- Manage local A and CNAME records on multiple Pi-hole instances.
- Ensure idempotent operations: records are added, updated, or removed based on the desired state.

## Requirements

- **Ansible:** 2.9 or later.
- **Python:** The control node must have the `piholev6api` library installed.
- **Pi-hole API Access:** Each Pi-hole instance must be accessible with a valid URL and API password.

## Role Variables

### `pihole_hosts`

A list of dictionaries representing the Pi-hole instances you want to manage. Each dictionary should include:

- `name`: The URL of the Pi-hole instance (e.g., `https://pi.hole`).
- `password`: The API password for the instance.

### `pihole_records`

A list of record definitions. Each record is a dictionary with the following keys:

* `name`: The DNS record name.
* `type`: The record type. Allowed values are `A` or `CNAME`.
* `data`: For A records, this is the IP address; for CNAME records, this is the target hostname.
* `state`: Desired state for the record. Allowed values are `present` or `absent`.
* `ttl`: (Optional, for CNAME records) Time-to-live value (default is 300 seconds).
